# UCSDUnfoldingMaps
Displays recent earthquakes data on a map

This project was the course project of the Coursera's 
[Object Oriented Programming in Java](https://www.coursera.org/learn/object-oriented-java) course.

## Data sources
- [USGS Earthquake Hazard Program](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/atom.php) - Earthquake data
- (Provided by the Course) - City and country data

## Extensions
As the final assignment, the Course's students are encouraged to create at least 3 "extensions" to the base application,
the ones that were created on this project are:
- You can switch between earthquake data feeds: past hour, day, week and month
- You can switch between a few Map Providers
- City Markers grow in size depending on their city population
- Coastal cities are marked with an upside down triangle
